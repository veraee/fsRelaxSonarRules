Simple Sonar Rules

_Hint for IDE:
Run `mvn test-compile` once before first test,
so that the dependencies of the java classes in "src/test/files" ("_UT dependencies_")are fetched
and placed in "target".

_IntelliJ IDEA:_
Run/Debug Configurations -> Before launch: Run Maven Goal: 'mvn test-compile'

Order of build:
1. Run Maven Goal
2. Build
